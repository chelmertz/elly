if someone else has the last comment in a thread (that I started), ignore it if I gave it a thumbs up (it should mean that they're working on it and that I don't have to follow up. either they should resolve the thread, or come back with a new comment in the same thread)

think about the GUI in something called https://graphite.dev/features/inbox and see if I can borrow something (they don't rank everything, for example, boo :))
