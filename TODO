bury some PRs (forget about them altogether). case in point: auto-tagged in pr description with @calle, so that I cannot opt out, for irrelevant PR (I changed some lines close to these changes)
put things into /internal
think about the GUI in something called https://graphite.dev/features/inbox and see if I can borrow something (they don't rank everything, for example, boo :))
